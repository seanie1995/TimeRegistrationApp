# 📱 TimeRegistrationApp

A mobile proof-of-concept time registration app built with React Native.  
It connects to a FileMaker database through a lightweight PHP Slim 4 API.

This project was developed as part of my graduation work at Chas Academy and served as a deep dive into fullstack mobile development.
